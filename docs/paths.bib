  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG) measure the weak electromagnetic signals generated by neuronal activity in the brain. Using these signals to characterize and locate neural activation in the brain is a challenge that requires expertise in physics, signal processing, statistics, and numerical methods. As part of the MNE software suite, MNE-Python is an open-source software package that addresses this challenge by providing state-of-the-art algorithms implemented in Python that cover multiple methods of data preprocessing, source localization, statistical analysis, and estimation of functional connectivity between distributed brain regions. All algorithms and utility functions are implemented in a consistent manner with well-documented interfaces, enabling users to create M/EEG data analysis pipelines by writing Python scripts. Moreover, MNE-Python is tightly integrated with the core Python libraries for scientific comptutation (NumPy, SciPy) and visualization (matplotlib and Mayavi), as well as the greater neuroimaging ecosystem in Python via the Nibabel package. The code is provided under the new BSD license allowing code reuse, even in commercial products. Although MNE-Python has only been under heavy development for a couple of years, it has rapidly evolved with expanded analysis capabilities and pedagogical tutorials because multiple labs have collaborated during code development to help share best practices. MNE-Python also gives easy access to preprocessed datasets, helping users to get started quickly and facilitating reproducibility of methods by other researchers.

  abstract = {We present an automated algorithm for unified rejection and repair of bad trials in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Our method capitalizes on cross-validation in conjunction with a robust evaluation metric to estimate the optimal peak-to-peak threshold -- a quantity commonly used for identifying bad trials in M/EEG. This approach is then extended to a more sophisticated algorithm which estimates this threshold for each sensor yielding trial-wise bad sensors. Depending on the number of bad sensors, the trial is then repaired by interpolation or by excluding it from subsequent analysis. All steps of the algorithm are fully automated thus lending itself to the name Autoreject. In order to assess the practical significance of the algorithm, we conducted extensive validation and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on four public datasets containing MEG and EEG recordings from more than 200 subjects. The comparisons include purely qualitative efforts as well as quantitatively benchmarking against human supervised and semi-automated preprocessing pipelines. The algorithm allowed us to automate the preprocessing of MEG data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) going up to the computation of the evoked responses. The automated nature of our method minimizes the burden of human inspection, hence supporting scalability and reliability demanded by data analysis in modern neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Abstract             SpecParam (formally known as FOOOF) allows for the refined measurements of electroencephalography periodic and aperiodic activity, and potentially provides a non-invasive measurement of excitation: inhibition balance. However, little is known about the psychometric properties of this technique. This is integral for understanding the usefulness of SpecParam as a tool to determine differences in measurements of cognitive function, and electroencephalography activity. We used intraclass correlation coefficients to examine the test-retest reliability of parameterized activity across three sessions (90~minutes apart and 30~days later) in 49 healthy young adults at rest with eyes open, eyes closed, and during three eyes closed cognitive tasks including subtraction (Math), music recall (Music), and episodic memory (Memory). Intraclass correlation coefficients were good for the aperiodic exponent and offset (intraclass correlation coefficients \&gt;\,0.70) and parameterized periodic activity (intraclass correlation coefficients \&gt;\,0.66 for alpha and beta power, central frequency, and bandwidth) across conditions. Across all three sessions, SpecParam performed poorly in eyes open (40\% of participants had poor fits over non-central sites) and had poor test-retest reliability for parameterized periodic activity. SpecParam mostly provides reliable metrics of individual differences in parameterized neural activity. More work is needed to understand the suitability of eyes open resting data for parameterization using SpecParam.},
