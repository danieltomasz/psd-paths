    "This report present a spectral analysis of a resting-state high-density EEG recordings.\n",
    "This dataset came with `GSN-HydroCel-257` EEG cap, which has 257 electrodes. The data was recorded at 1000 Hz sampling rate for 5 minutes with eyes closed. The preprocessing has the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Independent Component Analysis (ICA) was employed to remove eye blinks and other artifacts.\n",
    "- Bad channels were identified, marked, and interpolated using the nearest neighbours.\n",
    "- A bandpass filter of 0.5 - 70 Hz was applied, in line with the dataset authors' pre-filtering.\n",
